<h1>Private Events</h1>

<p>
A simple CRUD application built as part of the Odin Project. Users can create, browse and attend events. 
</p>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>
To practice building more complex associations in Ruby on Rails and utilizing the :belongs_to, :has_many and :has_and_belongs_to_many methods correctly.
</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Users can create, destroy and edit events</li>
    <li>Users can create or destroy attendance to an event (i.e. attend or skip an event they planned to attend)</li>
    <li>Users can invite other users to their hosted events.</li>
    <li>Invitees can respond to their invitations. Accepting an invitation creates attendance to the event.</li>
</ul>

<h2>To Do</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Clean up user interface</li>
    <li>Limit displayed events, create a 'see more' link</li>
    <li>Add clean up/archiving for expiring invitations</li>
